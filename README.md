# One-Button-Game
Small Link's Awakening Dungeon I made in two weeks for an assignment in my Game Programming class.

I recreated the assets from The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening to make a small dungeon.
All sounds and sprites have been borrowed from Nintendo (of course~)

Use the arrow keys to navigate the dungeon and make it to the super valuable treasure at the end!

Enjoy~
